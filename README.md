## Description and Objective: 
In pairs, use dummy data to create a mock movie database (akin to IMDB) and then use GraphQL and Apollo Express Server to query the data.  This exercise allowed us to practice creating appropriate schema and resolvers to query and mutate our 'database'.  

## Using:
- Javascript, GraphQL, Node.js

## Questions Encountered and Learning Acquired:
* Helpers - for best practice organization
    - A separate helper.js file can be added and used to store functions.  A constant containing all of the helper functions can then be exported and 'required' by the resolver.js file.  This makes the resolver.js file neater and easier to read.
